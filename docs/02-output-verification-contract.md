# Output Verification Contract

## Complete Output

Every meaningful output must state:

- source refs used
- changed paths or artifact refs
- evidence refs and verification refs, or why none exist
- verification attempted
- result: `passed`, `failed`, `blocked`, `skipped`, or `not_applicable`
- unverified surfaces
- residual risk
- human gate status when relevant

Do not claim verification that did not run.
Evidence and verification records should remain schema-valid, source-ref based,
and free of secrets or runtime ledger state.

## Verification Order

Start with the smallest relevant check, then widen only when the touched surface
requires it.

1. closest local review, schema check, unit, or command
2. lint, typecheck, build, contract check, or smoke check when applicable
3. broader suite only when scope, shared behavior, or PR readiness requires it

Use only commands backed by current repo files such as `Makefile`,
`pyproject.toml`, `tests/`, scripts, or CI. Current command details live in
`docs/reference/verification-ci-and-pr-reference.md`.

If a check cannot run, record the check name, reason, result state, residual
risk, and next action.

## PR Or Handoff Evidence

PRs, handoffs, and review packets should include intent, scope, changed paths or
artifacts, verifier results, docs impact, known risks, follow-up, and human
review focus.

For write work, include branch, worktree, base ref, changed paths,
allowed-write-target check, and conflict-check status when applicable.

For side effects, include tool or command, target surface, permission or gate
status, input refs, output or artifact refs, and verification or rollback note.

## Human Gate

Agents may push owned `agent/*` review branches and create or update PRs when
scope, branch/worktree ownership, verification, and evidence are clear.

Do not push directly to `main` or `master`. Do not merge; merge is a
human-only action and cannot be delegated by scope.

Release, deployment, CI/CD or GitHub Actions change, dependency change, secret
or credential handling, auth, billing, database migration or schema change,
infrastructure change, branch/worktree deletion, external write outside the
owned review branch or PR, public release, protected data change,
irreversible/protected action, or security-sensitive behavior requires explicit
human approval unless scope explicitly approves it.
